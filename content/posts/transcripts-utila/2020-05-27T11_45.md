Summary of [council meeting at 2020-05-27
11:45](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1714405722033643)

English starts at 03:45

On the 26th (Tuesday), two groups of islanders who were scheduled to be
repatriated were tested for COVID-19.
* The first group of 14 was completely clear, they will be brought to quarantine
  on the Keys before coming to Utila proper.
* The second group of 10 had 7 people who had come in contact with COVID-19 and
  the entire group will be staying the mainland.

This process, of rapid testing, will be used going forward before bringing
people to the 14 day quarantine on Utila. This test shows whether the person
has come into contact with COVID-19, not whether they currently have it.

The boat used to transport people to the Keys is also being used to take
criminals to the mainland, so there should be fewer issues locally.

There have also been reports of people entering the island illegally. If you
see someone strange or someone you haven't seen in a while, please report this
to the municipality. We don't want to be in the same situation as Roatan where
people came illegally and brought COVID-19 with them.

There is a process for bringing people back to Utila legally and this has been
running for 5 weeks. There is no need to come illegally.
