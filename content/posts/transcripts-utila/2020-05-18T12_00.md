Summary of [council meeting at 2020-05-18 12:00](https://www.facebook.com/328195770717532/videos/920602075031635/) and discussion of [municipal projects](https://www.facebook.com/328195770717532/videos/1160484530972150/)

Thanks to everyone for staying home during the quarantine, this helped with
ensuring we remain COVID-19 free.

Request to read and obey the [rules for local
commerce](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1292449427625490&id=328195770717532),
it's a two week trial and may not be renewed if the island doesn't follow the
rules. Note from Paul: I have summarised the rules on the
[curfew](/curfew/) page.

There is a meeting at Officina La Mujer at 15:00 today to go over the
biosecurity measures with restaurants. If you own or operate a restaurant,
please do to this meeting.

Projects:
* Build a new lighthouse:
  * Island is due for a new light house and rebuilding it will help with
    monitoring movement in and out of the island, expect it to provide long
    term value as the world changes
  * Aim for the design to look like an airport tower
  * Would like to have a RADAR and marine radios in it
  * Island wide project, get as many people involved as possible
  * Would like builders to present suggested designs
  * Aiming to get equipment by donation or at a reduced price
  * Setting up a fundraiser to collect funds
  * Project is starting immediately
* Health project:
  * Details tomorrow
