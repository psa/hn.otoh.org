Mixed Spanish and English. English 1:15 - End

Today the Utila Dream ferry brought 16 people with rapid tests which were over
1 month old. This contravenes the ordinance, which requires that rapid
diagnostic tests are no more than 72 hours old. This also represents a hazard
to the people of Utila as it potentially exposes everyone COVID-19.
