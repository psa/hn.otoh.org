Utila Dream brought the following equipment for the municipality today
* 1,784 KN95 masks
* 5,000 surgical masks
* 1 VPAP resmed sleep apnea machine
* 1 VPAP humidifier
* 1 Cannula kit
* 1 Intubation kit
* 72 Gloves
* 10 Medical gowns
* Note that this is slightly different from [the Governors
  post](https://www.facebook.com/gobernacionislas/posts/621512815158731) as
  some of the listed equipment was not for the municipality.

If you need a KN95 or surgical mask, you can stop at the municipality building
to pick one up.

The municipality has also been discussing with the doctors how to minimise
quarantine requirements and is changing the protocol for returning residents.
* If you have a negative PCR test, you will be able to stop quarantine and
  return home.
* The municipality is currently researching labs in La Ceiba and San Pedro
  Sula with the goal of recommending labs so that arrivals can get tested as
  soon as they arrive.
* The labs typically return results in 48-72 hours.
