Chief of Police: Moises Bodden

All police have been tested, no one is showing symptoms. So far all tests are
negative.

Thanks to The Dream for donating the tests so that all the police could be
tested. Police testing is important as they are patrolling the dock and thus
come in close proximity with incoming vessels and crew.

The police request that everyone wear masks and use hand sanitiser/gloves
whenever you go out. This allows them to focus on crime instead of chasing
people for biosecurity breaches.

People line up outside, distanced. Doctor has a bed and desk available to do
checks. Testing in the side room.

Thanks to everyone who helped clean up and provided the furniture.

Video shows processing of tests. Medical staff are wearing biosecurity garments
(long jackets, face masks, eye coverings, hair coverings, gloves).

Rapid tests take 15-20 minutes to get a result after a sample is drawn.

Results sent to La Ceiba take about a week to return.

Thanks to David Alderman for the new uniforms
* 18 uniforms donated
* Black camouflage military style uniforms

Thanks to Mr Shelby
* Been helping out the police
* Donating money to help people leave the island
* History of donations, including land for municipality buildings.

Mayor Bodden apologises for having to put in new rules, but they're required
for safety at the moment. We'll know more about what's needed longer term when
the PCR results come back.
