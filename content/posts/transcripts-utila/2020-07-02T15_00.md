* 17:20-19:05: Vice Mayor
* 21:45-24:30: Mayor

MAIZ:
* Have kits on the island
* Only for those who already have COVID-19
* Do not take this without medical assistance, it will not stop you from
  getting COVID-19

Protocol for treating those with COVID-19
* More information will be published in the next few days
* Special care for those with respiratory signs or symptoms
  * Provide better control for those who may have COVID-19
  * Reduces exposure for the general community
* Depending on the case, may treat at home or at Alton's school
* There will be a triage center operating to attempt to keep those who
  potentially have COVID-19 separated from those who do not

Oxygen Tanks:
* If you have empty oxygen tanks, the municipality would like to borrow them
* Tanks will be shipped to the mainland and filled at no charge for use by the
  municipality
* UDC has lent 3 tanks already

Virtual education:
* Donated internet has been run into Camponado so that the children there can
  receive virtual classes.

COVID-19:
* Going to be hard to keep it off the island
* Utila is the last of the Bay Islands without it
* If we're not careful, it will come to the island

Minimising Medical Incidents:
* Please be patient, try and avoid getting hurt
  * Be as careful as you can be on vehicles and at work/home
  * Want to avoid having to send people off to the mainland and then bring them
    back through quarantine
* Quarantine is getting harder, costs of energy and water are significant
  * Water on the Keys is getting low, when the tanks are empty won't be able to
    use the Keys any more
* If you see anything that could cause trouble, please inform the municipality
