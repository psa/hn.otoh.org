English: 00:00 - 09:50

Vandalism on the bridge and municipality building early Sunday morning
* Police were out until 03:00, so expect it was done between 03:00 and 04:00.
* If you have video footage or other information, please send it to the
  municipality.
* Concern over the mentality of unrest from the mainland making its way to
  Utila.
* HNL 25,000 / USD 1,000 reward for identifying the vandals.

There has been an effort to remove criminals from Utila during the pandemic
* Have removed about 350 people from the island
  * Found 50 minors without papers in the process
  * Includes 14 year olds brought over for prostitution and 2 girls with fake
    Utilian birth paperwork.
  * Lots of thieves and drug members removed
  * Over 50 of the people removed have a permanent ban from Utila

New rules have been drawn up and will be circulated soon
* Should be published tomorrow for comment
* New laws based on what's available legally for municipalities
* Took a month to write up
* Ferry will have restrictions on who it can bring to Utila to put some limits
  on criminal enterprise.

Looking at the pandemic as an opportunity to clean things up and restart the
island with a clean slate.
