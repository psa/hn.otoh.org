Summary of [council meeting at 2020-07-02
07:45](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=694736677982332)

English at the start, Spanish begins at 02:20

Reopening
---------

* The municipality will let us know well in advance before the island is
  reopened
* Closing the island off has worked for us so far
* Island is not yet prepared to reopen, would be a mistake to reopen in 2 weeks
  * Setting up a doctors office on the dock to manage rapid tests of incoming
    people
* 1,000 people/day or so being infected on the mainland, if we open up the
  ferry it's going to be difficult to avoid having infected people arrive
* Health is more important than business right now
