General Updates
---------------

[2020-07-02 07:35](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=694736677982332)

All English

New offices for the municipality
* Held first meeting in this office this morning
* Currently in the process of moving the municipality departments into the
  offices
* Moving into the building earlier than originally planned
  * Water, but no septic in the new building as of yet
  * Old municipality offices are going to be used as doctors offices for
    checking ferry passengers

Cargo boats:
* Have been doing rapid tests on the cargo boats every 15 days
  * If a crew member is positive, then that whole crew needs to be replaced and
    the boat disinfected.
  * The company may hire new crew to continue service

Quarantine:
* 10 people got out of quarantine today, so there will be new faces around the
  island

New building:
* Next to Central de Salud
* First floor has 5 rooms with 2 hospital beds each
  * Will have oxygen next to each bed
* 60 days will have the first floor done, in concrete
* Second floor will be 4 one room apartments
  * For doctors who are volunteering their time, so they don't have to worry
    about renting a place
* The budget for the new building came from the collection of 10 years of back
  taxes from one person, HNL 2,500,000

Medicine:
* Have purchased MAIZ kits to treat those who get sick
* Purchased PPE: goggles, gloves, face masks, suits and boots
  * Took about a month for this order to be processed and shipped to Utila
* From the bay islands donation fund:
  * Extra PPE
  * Rapid tests
  * A portable x-ray machine which cost USD 13,400
* Best medicine we have is keeping COVID-19 off the island
  * As long as we can keep it off the island we can live a fairly normal life

Food handouts:
* Have done 3 handouts to the poor
* Have stored food for one more handout
* No more funds for food after that

Alton's school:
* Next to the new municipal building
* 10 beds to quarantine COVID-19 cases
* Modifying the bathrooms to add showers

Reopening Update
----------------

[2020-07-02 09:00](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=3487716021261667)

English at the start, Spanish begins at 02:20

* The municipality will let us know well in advance before the island is
  reopened
* Closing the island off has worked for us so far, we've sacrificed a lot to
  stay healthy
* Island is not yet prepared to reopen, would be a mistake to reopen in 2 weeks
  * Setting up a doctors office on the dock to manage rapid tests of incoming
    people
* 1,000 people/day or so being infected on the mainland, if we open up the
  ferry it's going to be difficult to avoid having infected people arrive
* Health is more important than business right now, so not reopening the
  island for business at this time
