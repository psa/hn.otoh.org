  * Diarrhea

Rapid tests of staff at Bodden medical center:
* One staff member tested positive to a rapid test and also tested positive to
  a second rapid test.
  * PCR testing is being done to verify whether this person does or does not
    actually have COVID-19
  * This is not counted as a positive case until the PCR test comes back
* Tested all their family members living in the same house as well as close
  contacts
  * All of these tests came back negative
  * All of these people will be doing quarantine
* All the staff of the clinic will be PCR tested
* All health care staff will be following strict biosecurity measures as they
  work

Biosecurity:
* The virus spreads very, very easily among populations who do not follow
  biosecurity measures
* The use of face masks and hand sanitiser is mandatory
* Anyone arriving at the clinic (cento de salud) without a mask will not be
  attended to.

Updates:
* More updates daily
