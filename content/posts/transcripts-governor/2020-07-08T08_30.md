    returning to work
* No known cases on St Helene

PCR Machine:
* Still working towards getting a PCR machine for the Bay Islands
* Expecting it soon
* Will be able to get accurate results much faster and allow more accurate
  understanding where the virus is around the islands

Medicine:
* Shortage of medicine on Guanaja, but only some components such as zinc
* Medication from central government and purchased with donations has been
  shipped over to Guanaja
* Note that the medication is only for those who are exhibiting symptoms, not
  for everyone who tests positive

Treatment center:

* Bottom floor is for receiving people to do diagnostics and rapid testing and,
  if necessary, PCR

* 4 patients in the hospital, out of 10 beds allocated for intense care
  * 3 are stable
  * 1 is in a more serious situation

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Local flight reopening:
* It was 2020-07-15, but that hasn't been confirmed yet

Airport opening:
* There's a planned date, but it hasn't been confirmed yet
* Governor will share the date when it's confirmed


General
-------

Looking for donations of curtains:
* The Roatan health center in French Harbour wishes to put curtains between
  patients to provide some separation.
* If you have curtains to donate, please take them directly there

St Helene funding:
* Go through [The Make it Count
  Foundation](https://themakeitcountfoundation.org/)
* Anyone who wants to donate specifically for St Helene can tag their donation
  for that use

Utila:
* Utila is building a COVID-19 treatment center
* Need donations of equipment such as waterproof mattress covers
* To help, reach out to [Support Utila](https://supportutila.org)

Guanaja:
* There's a person fundraising specifically for Guanaja
  * Kina Heidel (sp?), a lawyer
  * Anyone interested in this should follow the link to the video and listen to
    the last 90 seconds as I couldn't really make out the name and probably
    spelled it wrong.

Salvo Conducto Form:
* There's a bug in the form that doesn't allow for leading zeros
* Workaround: Put a full stop (aka period) in front of the phone number or
  change the phone type to **general**

Crime:
* Unfortunately, expected as the economy suffers
* Police orders from Tegucigalpa are to enforce lockdown as a priority right now
* Weapons are not permitted inside of the home

Public Hospital Water:
* There's a problem with the well, so no running water
* Work started to repair it last week
