COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* 3 recovered cases
* 40 tests processed yesterday
* 4 new positive cases
* Total of 132 confirmed cases on the Bay Islands
  * Roatan, Santos Guardiola, La Ceiba (as this is where the Guanaja cases are
    currently living)
  * Positive cases means that when the person had the test they were positive.
    Yes, it does mean that they may have recovered since.
* Guanaja:
  * The 5 people who tested positive via PCR are living in La Ceiba, they're
    listed as Guanaja as that's where they primarily live.
  * There are, separately, some positive rapid tests waiting on PCR confirmation
* 163 pending tests
  * This number fluctuates heavily as new PCR kits are sent off for testing or
    the tests are completed

Projections:
* There are different models, current expected peak for Roatan is the third
  week of July
* Too early to tell on expected positive cases and fatalities
  * This is partly because there hasn't yet been a case of someone who's had a
    severe case and be treated for it at the hospital
  * The only known COVID-19 related fatality died 2 hours after getting to the
    hospital and was there for other medical issues

Symptomatic patients:
* Severe cases are being sent to the COVID-19 treatment center or a special
  wing of the hospital
  * Only two people currently hospitalised

Soto Cano:
* Have asked for help from Soto Cano before, but not as part of this pandemic

Transfer to mainland:
* Only one person has chosen to be transferred to the mainland for treatment
* This person is still listed as a Roatan case

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Reopening on 2020-07-15:
* Changes all the time, wait for the end of the week
* Individual municipalities will reopen based on their municipal rules
* Reopening plan has been written, can't be shared until it's approved by
  central government

International travel:
* Waiting for airport to be inspected and an official opening date

Travel to the mainland after 2020-07-15:
* Will know at the end of this week if this will be possible

Immigration and visas:
* There's an unofficial update, the governor has not yet heard an official
  update
* The rumor of tourists needing to leave by 2020-08-04 is not true

General
-------

Utila and Guanaja Mayors:
* Now doing their own updates
  * [Utila Municipality Videos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Municipalidad-de-Utila-328195770717532/videos/)
  * [Guanaja Municipality Videos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Municipalidad-de-Guanaja-1417968861802152/videos/)

Lockdown:
* No current confirmed end date
* Islands are currently as locked down as is reasonable (minimal business,
  restricted travel to a single day a week)
  * People are not listening to the government and are ignoring even this level
    of lockdown, trying to lockdown any further would be pointless
* Government is also concerned that if there is a more severe lockdown more
  people will lose their jobs
* Further lockdown during the peak is too early to tell

Financial support from federal government:
* There is something being worked on for the tourist industry, but it hasn't
  been finalised yet.
* No other support from them yet
