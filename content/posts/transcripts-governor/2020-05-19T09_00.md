Reopening
---------

Yesterday (Monday 2020-05-18) was the first day of opening internally.
* Bay Islands is the pilot project for Honduras
* Please remember biosecurity when going to restaurants
* Roatan hours: 06:00 - 20:00 for business, with people needing to be home by
  21:00

Why Reopen:
* If don't reopen, then businesses will continue to run out of money and fire
  people. They then won't have money to eat.
* External reopening:
* Shutdown as don't have infrastructure to face the virus
  * Buying time while we get equipment and setup process
  * Working closely with doctors

Travel and Repatriation
-----------------------

People entering Santos Guadiola illegally:
* Division between municipalities was closed, it is open for now
  * Be careful as the test results have not come back yet
* 03:00 a boat illegally came into Jonesville with 30 people aboard
  * Only 9 presented themselves
  * Captured 7
  * 14 still missing
  * Many of these people are related to Santos Guardiola local authorities
    * Not the mayor, who has been helping to clean up the mess
* No idea if the people are infected or not. Have tested everyone so far and
  will test anyone else captured.
* Agreement with mayor Gilbert
* Mayors office of Santos Guardiola has agreed to pay for the plane to send the
  test kits
* If this happens again, the municipality will close down
* If any test results come back positive, the reopening will be shut down and
  the Bay Islands will go into full lockdown
* There is a plan in the works to bring people back to the islands, there's no
  need for this.
* Are taking legal action against those who came illegally
* RADAR didn't detect them as it's on the West side of the island

Issues with people coming illegally:
* This puts everyone in danger
* May stop the ability to reopen
* Important to help out authorities during the pandemic
* Remember, the constitution was suspended for the period of the pandemic
  * Anyone who does anything that could spread the virus has committed a crime
    which is punishable by 6 months to 2 years
  * The virus is that contagious, please take it seriously
* Have patience, there is a project to return people to the islands underway

Why was Roatan not shutdown when people came:
* Only two people, quickly tested

Spending the USD 200,000 donations to return islanders:
* This is a numbers problem
* Spending all of the money to help out the 200-300 people stuck on the
  mainland vs spending it to help the 100,000 people on the islands doesn't
  make sense
* USD 200,000 doesn't go far
* Have funded 3 projects:
* Treatment center
* USD 25,000 for helping those off the islands
* USD 15,000 for food and medicine for Guanaja
* USD 150,000 reserved for testing

Next weekend:
* Large project to return islanders from mainland
* Close collaboration with doctors, the project is conditional on their assent
* Will be a press conference run by the doctors coming shortly
* Process has been established, a hotel will be used to quarantine people and
  they will have to pay for meals (about USD 50).
  * The USD 25,000 set aside for those stuck outside the islands will be used
    to mitigate these costs.
  * Funding allocation will be decided by the commission
  * If you have the capacity to pay, please do so so that the donation money
    can be used for those who can not afford the expense
* Cost of getting people over is being covered by the islands

Absolute curfew during the repatriation project this weekend?
* Please wait for the press conference that's specific to the repatriation

Seamen returning to Honduras:
* Honduras is allowing citizens to return
* This is not common in the Caribbean (Jamaica isn't allowing them to return,
  for instance)

Immigration office:
* Didn't open yesterday
* Waiting for authorisation for those who overstayed visa during crisis

Request for repatriation flight from Roatan to USA:
* We can discuss it
* No word yet on July flights

General
-------

Funded Projects
* USD 25,000 used to help people stuck on mainland both to survive and to come
  back
* Guanaja project for food and medicine

Utila getting same help as Guanaja?
* Guanaja is in a much worse situation than any other place in the Bay Islands
* Oversight committee looked into their situation and decided to allocate some
  money for them
* Guanaja has twice the population of Utila

RECO:
* Looks like a problem with doing receipts this month, many bills are higher
  than possible
* Investigation is ongoing

Banking:
* Governor going to meeting with bank managers
* Some have been enforcing numbers this week, others not. Aim is to get all
  banks doing the same thing.

Ventilators:
* Currently have 2
* A project in the works to help this

Reach out to WHO for epidemiological study?
* They will look into it, like the idea

Limit to number of employees at work?
* Depends on how close they are
