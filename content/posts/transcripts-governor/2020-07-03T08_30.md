COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* 127 confirmed by PCR
  * Roatan, Santos Guardiola, Guanaja
  * Utila still doesn't have any cases, but it's still important to be aware of
    symptoms and potential infection
* 90 tests pending
* Gracias a Dios now has COVID-19 (this was the last department without it).
  It's a very remote area, but they now have 33 cases.
  * 166 people went from Roatan to Gracias a Dios last week
  * The tests which came up positive have been waiting for two to three weeks
    and pre-date the return of people to Gracias a Dios from Roatan

Hospital selection:
* Which hospital a patient goes to depends on what is wrong with them
* There are many specialties which are not covered by the Roatan hospital
  * For example, there is no orthopedic surgeon, so broken bones will go to the
    mainland
* Last week an appendicitis case from Guanaja was operated on in the Roatan
  hospital, as an example of preferring that over the mainland.

PPE and Healthcare volunteers:
* Yes, still needed. Please fill in [this
  form](https://forms.gle/ja8CtoHGA1Dx3JgaA)

New police who tested positive:
* They have finished their quarantine time, but haven't left quarantine yet.
  They are staying a little longer as an extra precaution.
