COVID-19
--------

First case of COVID-19 has arrived on Roatan
* Won't disclose who, but is part of the group who was smuggled in
* Is in Santos Guardiola
* There's a lot of discrimination against people who may have it, please don't
  share photos of these people

Tests of smuggled in people:
* 8 tested: 1 positive, 7 waiting
  * Person who is COVID-19 positive is asymptomatic, they can still infect
    others
* Will re-test everyone in this population as they were all exposed.
* These people voluntarily turned themselves in. Coming in was bad, but at
  least they turned in and so went to quarantine and got tested

People who came into contact with those smuggled into Santos Guardiola
* Emergency Number: +504-8820-2444
* Will keep identification confidential
* Will not take legal action against anyone as finding out scope is more
  important than prosecuting people
* Hoping it's contained, looking for collaboration just to find out how
  widespread the COVID-19 outbreak is.

Smuggled people:
* 14 people still at large, would like help finding them
* There were 2 boats used to get people in
* Arrived at 03:00, presented themselves to quarantine at 06:00
  * Don't know what they did or who they came into contact with between those
    times
  * Need to identify everyone they came in contact with so they can be tested

COVID-19 treatment center:
* 3 groups of people with COVID-19:
  * Asymptomatic
  * Constant medical supervision
  * Intensive care
* The treatment center only treats those needing supervision and intensive care

PCR vs Rapid Response tests:
* Rapid response: blood tests, specificity and accuracy
  * Positives and negatives have who different scales
  * Tests are not always accurate, have different accuracies for positives and
    negatives
* PCR: molecular tests, sample taken from nose
  * Very accurate
  * The positive result was a PCR test

Reopening and Return to Curfew
------------------------------

Reopening halted:

* This affects the entire department (this includes Utila, Guanaja and Roatan)
* Federal decision to halt, locally tried to keep things running

  * Governor has expressed a hope that the outbreak can be contained and we can
    try again by the weekend

Returning Bay Islanders:
