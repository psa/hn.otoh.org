COVID-19
--------

Test results from those who skirted quarantine:
* Not yet
* Note from Paul: As I write this, on Sunday, one has come back positive from
  this group

Travel and Repatriation
-----------------------

Cruise ships:
* Carnival Glory arrived at Mahogany Bay
* Dropped of 274 Hondurans, 32 of which are islanders
  * Firemen managed the decontamination
  * Then health did a checkup
  * Then they went through immigration to the quarantine zone for their island
    or the mainland
* Rhapsody of the Seas came on Thursday
* Tuesday the Norwegian ship will arrive and return Honduran citizens
* Are working with any cruise line that wants to repatriate people, as long as
  they reach out to the Bay Islands government.

Returning Mainlanders:
* This is confirmed and will happen soon
* Not going to share the date or time as there's a lot of discrimination
  against those who have been in places where there is COVID-19
  * Minimise chance of plan being disrupted

Repatriation from the USA:
* Will work on it once the mainland project has completed

Immigration for those sailing:
* Institution of Property will be open on Monday

Visa expired before crisis started:
* Talk to a lawyer, not sure what's going to happen as it was before the crisis
  started.

Coordinating charters from Kenya:
* Send email to the governor via goberndorislas@gmail.com

Plan to open to tourists:
* Largely up to the cruise ships and airlines deciding they're ready to open up
  again.
* There's a plan being developed for when the reopening does occur
* CDC will be a key player in the conditions as they'll be the ones setting the
  cruise ship regulations
* Florida Caribbean Cruise Ship Association (FCCA) has been working closely
  with the islands on reopening plans
* Lots of calls with US and Canadian governments

Ferry from Utila to Roatan:
* Have already moved a lot of people this way, let the governor know if you
  want to be on the next trip

June/July rumor for reopening:
* Nothing has been planned yet

Tegucigalpa to Roatan:
* Reach out to the commission that's responsible for bringing Bay Islanders back

General
-------

Opening days/hours:
* As of the 18th of May, the Mayors office determined the hours
* Go see your mayors ordinance, it's on the [curfew](/curfew) page for Utila
  and [here](https://www.facebook.com/gobernacionislas/posts/582069049103108)
  for Roatan

Taunting Mainlanders:
* Please stop taunting mainlanders or the central government about the Bay
  Islands being open while the rest of the country is closed

Absolute Curfew Notification from Friday:
* This was just for the mainland, not the Bay Islands
* Sunday was meant to be the time when the mainlanders returned home and there
  was a plan involving curfew for the Bay Islands, but this was decided against.

Donations:
* Go through Make it Count Foundation, not governors office
* Run by oversight committee
* Up to the committee to work out how to subsidize those coming from the
  mainland

Financial help for those now unemployed:
* Depends on industry and type of job loss
* Please send case to the governor to discuss case specifics

Banks:
* Some still using digit system, some not
* On Monday, will allow general entry

Schools:
* No clear answer yet

Put out official communication about no curfew:
* Please share the municipal ordinance from last week

Paying for Quarantine:
* Islands unfortunately are too poor to pay for everyone's quarantine

RECO Update:
* They're checking every bill to adjust them

Paying personal tax:
* Request for police record is stopping some people paying (police won't give
  them out)
* Governor will look into it

Oversight committee:
* There will be a meeting on Tuesday with them and an update from the Governor
  on Tuesday afternoon at 15:00
