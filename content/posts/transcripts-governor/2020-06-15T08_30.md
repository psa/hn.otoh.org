COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Confirmed cases:
* 18 confirmed cases
  * 3 showing mild symptoms, rest are asymptomatic
  * Treatment center is for medium to high symptoms so no one is there yet
  * Treatment center can take 30 and be expanded to 60
* 72 tests pending, all have taken rapid tests, some are showing symptoms
  * These are mostly from contract tracing
* If you don't have to be out and about, stay home to minimise spread

Sickness level of those on the island:
* In order to get the recovered status, need a PCR test to confirm COVID-19 free
* Some people have probably recovered, but haven't confirmed with tests
* Don't have many PCR tests so are focusing on those who don't have it rather
  than re-testing those who do.
  * Focus on treatment and monitoring status for those with COVID-19

Treatment:
* Pharmacies will sell you MAIZ so if you can afford it please get it
  * Some pharmacies may require a prescription
  * Costs HNL 1,800 - 2,500 per person
  * This cost is why they are focusing assistance on those who can not afford
    it
* CATRACHO is for those who are hospitalised, so no need to purchase it

Quarantine:
* Don't have capacity to monitor every house to ensure people are quarantining
* There is a person who is legally responsible for each person coming in to
  ensure these people are staying in quarantine
  * This person will be held responsible if someone reports a person in
    quarantine outside (send a photo to report people breaking quarantine).

Hospitals:
* There are discussions with both Hospital Woods and Cemesa to treat medium to
  high cases of COVID-19
* The treatment centers are only for low to medium cases.

Medical staff:
* There is only one infectologist for the entire Bay Islands and she has been
  working since day one
* Physicians who are available have been hired
