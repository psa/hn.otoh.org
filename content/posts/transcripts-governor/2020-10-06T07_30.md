    sharing information about test results.

Medical brigades:
* Replicating the successful program from the mainland
* Going door to door, mobile units of 66 doctors
* Were only meant to stay for 14 days (which is over), but work is being done
  to try and keep them longer as they've been extremely helpful.
* Doing medical evaluations, rapid testing, referrals and provide medication

* If you missed the brigade, let the governor know and they will try to
  schedule medical staff as quickly as possible
