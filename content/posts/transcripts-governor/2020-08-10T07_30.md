COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* From bay islands health department press release 57
* Case counts are split between national lab and regional lab
* 186 results pending from the national lab as of 2020-08-08
* 1 recently processed in the national lab
* 47 PCR tests done in the regional lab
  * Includes Guanaja, Roatan and Santos Guardiola
  * 21 positive cases from the regional lab
* 227 confirmed cases
* 90 recovered (PCR confirmed)
* 3 deaths
* 134 active cases

COVID-19 center in Roatan:
* Lab in Roatan is now up and running
* Not designed for testing everyone, still case by case
* Bottom floor is fully operational 07:00 - 19:00 daily
* Reserved for people who don't have the economic means and are symptomatic
  * If you can afford to, please use a private lab to get tested
  * Have used 3,000 of the 4,000 rapid test kits; only have 1,000 left
  * Have more PCR kits, but those are for people who are at risk or have
    advanced symptoms
* You can have oxygen saturation tested at the clinic
* There are agreements with 12 clinics on the mainland which have received VPAP
  machines from Roatan to take patients if Roatan gets overloaded
* Now have 37 COVID-19 beds, of which 6 are occupied

Cases causing closer:
* There are currently no plans to close again based on infection rates
* The government currently believes that the islands can not afford another
  closure
* The government thinks they are as prepared as they can be to manage the
  infection rate
  * Funding for COVID-19 treatment center from the mayors office, central
    government and a Latin America Interdevelopment Bank

PCR test kits:
* Have a medium supply at this time
* Governor did not directly answer whether more kits were being ordered

Avifavir:
* No details on this yet, governor will ask

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Airport:
* The original plan was to open all airports in Honduras on 2020-08-10
* Mayor of Roatan made a petition to continue the existing system for flight
  arrivals for this week
  * This system required authorisation from central government for the flight
    and authorisation from the municipality they're going to
  * Guarantee that everyone who's coming in has a purpose and has been tested
    * Avoid opening a floodgate and spiking cases
    * Expect peak of cases to be 2020-08-15
  * System for this week requires authorisation from the destination
    municipality, nothing from central government
    * This authorisation usually just requires a recent PCR or rapid COVID-19
      test showing a negative result
* Roatan airport was never shut down, was doing humanitarian flights with
  authorisation
* If you are coming from the mainland, the airlines know what the procedures
  are. Communicate with them to ensure requirements are met.
  * There's an online form to fill in
* 2020-08-17 is the currently planned date for international flights to start
  * When this opens it will be unrestricted, tourists and residents will all be
    permitted to travel

American Airlines:
* Flight may be cancelled (some people have cancellation notices, but it's
  still listed as scheduled in some places).
* Not sure why, the flight was nearly full, it is being looked into

Testing for incoming flights:
* There are no requirements for those arriving to take a test in Honduras
* Everyone (national and international) must present a negative test result at
  the airport
  * PCR, quick test and antibody tests are all acceptable
* Municipalities/islands may have more different rules
  * e.g. Utila currently requires a PCR test
* There are private labs which will be able to do testing at the airport
  * The governor strongly discourages using these, it's better to get tested
    before travel
  * If an arrival test comes out positive, the person will be sent back on the
    next returning flight
* There is currently no information on how close to arrival the test needs to
  have been done

Testing of outgoing passengers:
* Honduras does not require you to have a test to leave, only to arrive
* Destination countries may have testing requirements

Concerns against starting incoming flights:
* The Bay Islands is concerned that if flights aren't permitted back soon, the
  airlines will stop coming to Roatan and take up flights elsewhere. This would
  make economic recovery even harder.
* Tourism is a highly competitive industry, especially in the Caribbean
* Opening flights doesn't mean that the island will immediately have full
  tourism again, it might take a year or so before that happens

Immigration office:
* These are open
* Apparently asking for appointments
* Immigration chat on WhatsApp can help with the process

Getting to Utila:
* No ferries running right now
* Governor doesn't know if it's cheaper/easier to get a boat/charter flight
  from Roatan or La Ceiba at this time.

Number system:
* Expect the number system to continue until 2020-08-21
* This means it will be active for the first few days that international
  flights are permitted

General
-------

Earthquake:
* 5.7 quake this morning

Curfew:
* Extended to 20:00
* Weekends are still closed
* Still using digit system
* Governor understands that this is confusing, especially with the airport
  opening on weekends.
* Extension of hours helps out restaurants

Donations:
* See left sidebar for how to donate
* Make It Count Foundation has brought in USD 265,000 in cash and USD 400,000
  in material donations
* Make It Count Foundation is creating a report detailing how funds were spent

Concern over people coming to the island looking for jobs:
* Between the flight costs and the COVID-19 test cost, that's a lot of money to
  spend. Seems highly unlikely for people to do so, especially coming to an
  island which is tourism based when tourism is deeply troubled.
* If people pay for testing and the flight, they'll have a reason.
