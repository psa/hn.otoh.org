COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* 132 PCR confirmed cases on the Bay Islands
  * Guanaja and Utila have positive rapid tests
  * Best strategy with fighting COVID-19 is to locate and help those who have it
    * Get tested if you have symptoms
    * Don't stigmatise or discriminate against those who have it
* 164 PCR test results outstanding
* 4 people hospitalised at this moment, all are stable right now
* All 18 departments in Honduras now have COVID-19

Testing:
* In the COVID-19 treatment center the tests are free
* Doctor on duty determines who gets tested

Masks for Guanaja and Utila:
* Central government hasn't sent any for these islands yet
* Will be giving out masks as soon as they are available
* Medical personal have a supply, but it's to keep them safe while they treat
  COVID-19 patients and there aren't enough to be giving out to everyone else.

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Closing Honduras:
* Entirely false rumors
* The Bay Islands are basically already on lockdown so the governor expects it
  won't get any stricter

General
-------

Reopening:
* Lock down currently ends 2020-07-12, expectation is that it'll be extended by
  14 days
  * We were meant to reopen on the 15th, but the expectation is that this will
    now be turned into a slower reopening process.
* If there's a major change, the governor will have another transmission
* Only expect changes in the lock down protocol for Tegucigalpa and San Pedro
  Sula as they have a lot of cases.
* Central government requires that people only go out once every two weeks and
  the governor is unable to change it to two numbers per day.
