Ferry to Bay Islands
* Needs reopening of entire country
* 15 July target

Opening restaurants:
* Delivery is OK
* 8th of June for general opening

Positive test cases affect reopening?
* Will impact ability to do regional faster opening
* The plan to reopen the country is still underway though, so will reopen on
  that timeline even if we can't do something faster

Immigration
* Trying to open this week

Reopening businesses:
* Get a salvo conducto from the police stations including business owners and
  all employees
  * Chamber of tourism can help out here
* Business operators can prepare for next weeks opening

COVID-19 on the islands and reopening:
* It's probably been here a long time, we just haven't been able to find it
* Testing is important
* Project to open up is the whole country

Testing and Medical
-------------------

Nomenclature:
* IgM is those who have the virus and are contagious
* IgG is those who have had the virus and are no longer contagious
* Double negative: both IgM and IgG are negative

Donated Medical devices
* 200 for the Bay Islands (not just Roatan)
  * Arriving by boat shortly
  * Oversight committee paid for shipping
* Also donated for San Pedro Sula, they have arrived already as it was more
  urgent

Number of respirators on Island:
* Will answer on Wednesday

Rapid testing:
* Rapid tests not based on contact tracing from this person
  * Everyone else in that group from the mainland was tested and came back
    negative
* Remainder of tests are those who have come into quarantine or exhibit symptoms
* Rumor about hospital security was inconclusive the first time but deeper
  testing came out negative for both IgM and IgG, this is why they don't share
  results until PCR tests are done
* People who get a rapid test positive are quarantined

PCR testing on islands:
* Has been difficult to get testing equipment as most countries that can are
  hoarding, expect to get some donated after the crisis is over

Handling tourists who get COVID-19 in the Bay Islands:
* They will be sent to the Roatan treatment center

People who have had the virus arriving:
* Expect that those with the virus will need to be quarantined, those immune
  will be OK
* Not fully sure about quarantine rules at this time

Allowing those who have been self quarantining to return:
* There is exposure during the transit process, so can't give a blanket pass

Request for applying time at sea to quarantine time:
* Private message the governor
