Repatriation
------------

145 people returned to the islands on 2020-05-27.
* Joint operation between all the mayors and the congressman
* Those who can afford to are going to a hotel for their quarantine
* The group who can't afford to stay in the hotel is being housed in a center
  that was donated for this use and will be acknowledged at the end of the
  pandemic.
* The ferry company donated the travel
* Every person was tested using rapid response tests before being brought over

Use the legal means to get over to the islands:
* Please campaign to stop people from trying to come to the islands in any
  manner other than the organised one
* Every municipality has a mechanism to bring people home
* Using the official channel to get home keeps everyone safe.

Assist on repatriation to USA:
* Can help
* Also reach out to the US embassy

Contacting embassy for those in the USA:
* If you are Honduran in the USA, you need to contact the Honduran officials
  not the US embassy

Returning those stuck in the USA:
* This is the focus now that the majority of those from the mainland have
  returned.
* There is a second trip being organised for those still on the mainland

Repatriation from Trinidad:
* Tough to do

Repatriation from Cayman:
* Get together and make a list
* Cayman air will need to be able to justify the flight

Marines stuck in Africa:
* This is the first the governor is hearing of it, please send him details

Testing
-------

Federal Government updates:
* Daily list by the government which includes all confirmed cases
* PCR test results for the Bay Islands: 1 confirmed, 58 negative, 7 pending
* Some rapid response tests have come back positive, they are being tested via
  PCR to confirm whether the person does or does not have COVID-19
  * Rapid response also picks up malaria, dengue and others, so please wait to
    hear back on the PCR results.
* Official address daily between 18:00 and 19:00

Test timeline:
* Tests take 48 hours to be returned, in most cases

Testing quarantined people:
* Will do regular repeat tests
* No one has tested positive yet
* Doctors also provide a kit as a prophylactic to minimise transfer
* Anyone who tests positive will have quarantine extended and need to get a
* second, negative test before being released

Names of those who test positive for personal contact tracing:
* Keeping names private to avoid discrimination
* Also avoiding violence as have seen quite a lot of it on the mainland

Person who tested positive:
* In quarantine
* Asymptomatic
* Contact tracing has been done
* Everyone in quarantine with this person will be PCR tested again before
  release

Contact Tracing:
* Being done for everyone who tests positive on the rapid response as well as
  PCR
* Being done while we wait for the PCR tests to be returned

General
-------

Roatan spray tunnels:
* No money from the foundations went to these projects, it was entirely funded
  by the municipality.
* The governor was just sharing what other departments are doing
* Tunnels acquisition has been community driven
* Please direct concerns about the spray tunnels to the people running them 

Curfew:
* Currently same as national
* Expires on Saturday
* If no more cases, then are hoping to convince the federal government to allow
  the islands to open again.

Support Utila:
* Have a 501(c)(3), so tax deductible for US tax payers

Incoming tourist flights:
* Being worked on by chamber of tourism

Rumors:
* Most have turned out to be misinterpreted (for example, a sea burial)
* Please continue to report things you see

Protocol for airports when tourists return

* Will work closely with airlines

Expired visas:
* Wait until immigration office is opened again

Businesses opening:
* Only those allowed by SINAGER

People smuggled in:
* Currently only have the 16 who turned themselves in initially
* Still looking for the rest

Contacting family members in quarantine:
* Last night was busy and went late, try contacting them again
* Mobile reception is poor in that area, try contacting someone else in the
  group to see if they have better reception.

ICU:
* Both the public and private hospitals have ICU wards

Ventilators sent to Honduras
* All of these went to the mainland
* The Bay Islands still only has 2
