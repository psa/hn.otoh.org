Hospitalisation:

  * 42 in the COVID center
* Some have been released, but the number has remained stable as new cases come
  in
* No information for Guanaja or Utila

  the governor

Health Workers:
* 64 new health workers coming into the islands
* Supporting COVID-19 center and hospital
* Also setting up new triage centers where people can go to get checked out
* Provide support and a break to the existing doctors

Test kits:
* Have about 300 test kits for PCR machines on the mainland
  * These are the tests that get sent to the mainland for processing
* Not sure how many quick tests remain or whether there is remaining reagents
  for the pocket

If you got a PCR test done and it needed to be sent to the mainland, you'll
need to contact the health department for results.
* Current expectations are 3-5 days to get results

PCR tests are available from most private labs and hospitals.
* Public sector PCR tests are reserved for those without the financial means to
  pay for one themselves
* Heath Miller recommends the

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Guides for entry:
* The governors team is creating a guide to help with traveling

[COVID-19 Immigration forms](https://prechequeo.inm.gob.hn/):
* Filling these in online just helps the process move faster
* There is no approval or denial, the test result is only approve/deny in this
  process

There is no estimate for how much longer PCR testing will be required to enter
Honduras

General
-------

Thanks to volunteer translators and transcribers (hey, that's me!).
Also thanks to transport companies which have been moving people and equipment
at low or no cost.

* 2 digits per day
* Being outside is permitted 06:00-20:00
* Red alert extended to 2020-10-04

Police:
* It's important to get the police officers name in order to file a report
* It's easier to get the police officers name if you are respectful
* People cursing at the police is not helping, please be respectful
* Also go to the human rights office and make sure the district attorney if you
  are having trouble getting your complaint attended to
