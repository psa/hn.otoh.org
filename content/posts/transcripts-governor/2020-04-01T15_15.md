Donations
---------

Received a large donation of PPE today.

Message the governor if you have a donation or know of someone who does

Donation Partners:
* Soul Foundation
* Marine Park Foundation
* Rotary Club
* Mayors and Congressman's office
* Tourism Bureau
* Long list of volunteers

Funding levels:
* Get as many funds as possible, this is going to run for a long time
* Current total: USD 109,733.00; HNL 2,718,251
* Still looking to get a match on the USD 100,000

Where money to be spent:
* Will use information from the following to make funding decisions, each has a
  specific focus to help inform those decisions:
  * Tourism Bureau: Who's hurting because of the loss of tourism income
  * Bay Island Association of Doctors: What do we need for medical equipment,
    what do we have in the way of equipment and medical staff
  * Mayors and Government offices: Who's hungry

Foundation:
* Formal letter to be able to send to potential donors is a great ideal, will
  work on getting one written up.

Curfew
------

Police Focus:
* Self police on which day you shop
* Police officers need to focus on crime
* Please let people know about which days people can shop and how much damage
  COVID-19 can do, not everyone knows or understands

Lock down and people getting outside:
* Need to do more testing so we can really find out if we have COVID-19 before
  we open things up

Exercise:
* Opening gyms to be a tough sell as they have group interaction issues
* If you need to go running and do so in the early mornings when there's no one
  around, you should be fine.

Shopping and banking for seniors (65 and older):
* 07:00 - 09:00 Mon, Wed, Fri
* Banks and supermarkets are meant to be open early, contact governor if local
  bank isn't doing so.

Ordering Groceries:
* Use WhatsApp (most companies have it) to order ahead.
* Companies like Eldons are doing a great job, including send photos of goods

Coxen Hole having gatherings:
* Will need to be stricter here as there are too many people gathering

St. Helene allowed to travel:
* Allowed within the same municipality
* We are avoiding travel between the islands (e.g. no travel between Utila and
  Roatan or vice versa)

Will shops be open on Easter:
* Normal curfew applies

Patrols at night:
* Yes, just limited by police

Restaurants:
* Communicado was that restaurants can't have people eating in them, they're
  permitted to do delivery and take out.

Cadena nacional on local businesses
* Governor hadn't seen it yet, will look into it and having a local communicado

COVID-19
-------

Testing:
* 23 negative tests returned
* 2 pending, Roatan East End and Santos Guardiola

PPE for Utila:
* Aware, trying to get as quick as possible

Cargo boats:
* Recognised as most likely path for COVID-19 to enter the islands
* Strict checks on boats on the way in to double check that there's no one
  being smuggled in
* Companies are being very responsible in this regard

Flights and Travel
------------------

Last international flight was yesterday
* Lots of people saying they're looking forward to coming back when they can

Travel between the islands:
* Trying to avoid that right now to limit transmission

People who travelled on the La Ceiba Ferry:
* On Roatan, some in shelter as they don't have food

Utila:
* People are travelling from the mainland to Utila
* Recommend regular patrols to stop boats
  * This is being done as of today
* Can't reopen as there have only been a few tests and it's extremely
  vulnerable given the proximity to the mainland.
* Cargo boat inspections like on Roatan: Talk to the mayor

Travel to the islands from the mainland:
* Not yet, working on it

General
-------

Utila Cargo:
* Meant to be running

Food from La Ceiba:
* Cargo has not been stopped

Ecuador:
* They're having issues, hopefully won't come to the Bay Islands or the rest of
  Honduras

COVID-19 team:
* Featuring Shelly Burich - President of Rotary Club of Roatan

Mall banks and Western Union:
* Trying to get banks that only have locations at the mall open
* Ban Pais is open and they do Western Union

Working:
* If staff have a specific task to attend to it sounded like they governor said
  they could work, the transmission cut out though

Hardware stores:
* Some were open today

Paying taxes:
* There's a communicado on that, governor will help

Davivienda and US checks:
