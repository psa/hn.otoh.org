Rapid tests:

* Got 335 test kits yesterday which will be used for testing medical staff

Those getting a positive rapid test are quarantined while we wait for the PCR
results.

Reporting resolved cases:
* Testing is being done on potential positive cases rather than potentially
  cured cases.
* Reporting on resolved cases is being done as those tests are done

Medical volunteers

  volunteer).
* The governor will work to get volunteers onto the islands.
* Volunteers can choose to go to a specific island if they want

Biosecurity:
* Seeing lots of reports on social media showing people not following
  biosecurity measures.
* Following biosecurity measures is not about ourselves, it is about our
  community
