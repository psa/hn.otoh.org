    local government
* Sat/Sun closed, no circulation
  * Groceries, pharmacies, restaurants can do deliveries on the weekend
* Still using ID digit system restricting who can go out
  * There will be a document over the weekend which tells us which number will
    be used on Monday. It will _probably_ be 6 as last week was 1-5.

    can only go to restaurants on their allocated day.

  conducto
