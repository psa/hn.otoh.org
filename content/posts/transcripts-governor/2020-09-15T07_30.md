COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* Health Department release 74 from Sunday
  * 896 confirmed cases total
    * 146 recovered
    * 12 deaths confirmed (up to 20 suspect)
    * 738 active cases
  * 218 outstanding tests, 132 processed and 86 pending
    * The Bay Islands is currently spiking, while the rest of the country is
      recovering

Hospitalisation:
* Total of 60 hospitalised patients in Roatan
  * 23 in the hospital
  * 37 in the COVID center
* No information for Guanaja or Utila

Weekend Case Spike:
* Difficult as 200+ new case record, lots of alarm
* First call of the morning suggested a 2 week lockdown
  * Got all the experts along with the chambers of tourism and commerce
    together to work out if this was necessary
  * Worked out that a shutdown was not constructive, given the broad existing
    infection rates.
  * The test results are from the last two weeks of August and the first two
    weeks of September (so many old tests)
  * Medical brigades are being sent from the central government. Some today and
    tomorrow.
* If you see someone without a mask, please encourage them to put one on
* Police will be handing out fines for people not wearing masks

Strategy for Management:
* Herd immunity is not a strategy being implemented in Honduras
  * Lockdown was the strategy, this is what lead to the first case being in May
    instead of March
  * Currently, locking down further will exacerbate economic issues which is
    expected to cost more lives than cautious reopening and medical brigades
* No way of stopping the virus, especially now that it's at community level
  * House to house medical brigades aim to control the infection rate and help
    those who are infected but have not managed to get to a clinic
* Despite trying to keep it out, it is estimated that around 40% of the people
  on the Bay Islands have been exposed
* Current strategy is to identify those at the highest risk and save them
* Problems Honduras has to deal with that places like South Korea don't:
  * People who don't care if they get sick. They don't necessarily realise that
    they're spreading it to others.
  * People who think the virus is a lie.

COVID-19 center
* For people with symptoms, not to get testing
* Bay Islands have already gone through 7,000 tests and there aren't many left
* People who are showing symptoms will get tested

Antigen testing
* Private clinics have these available

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Testing Requirements:
* Not sure how long the 72 hour requirement will be in place

General
-------

Independence day:
* Today is 199 years of independence for Honduras.
* Appreciation for all the healthcare workers who are really showing what it
  means to be patriotic.
* Please give back to the healthcare workers by wearing a mask and following
  other biosecurity measures.

Circulation:
* Only people with salvo conductos and tourists with confirmed reservations
* Tomorrows digit is 5 (which was today's, but was pushed to tomorrow due to the
  holiday)
* Only banks will ask you for your number, otherwise when its your day you can
  circulate freely

Dengue:
* Increase of dengue leading to combination of dengue with COVID-19, which is
  especially dangerous
  * Can't take blood thinners on dengue, which is necessary for COVID-19
* Spraying is being done to reduce the mosquito population

Criteria for ending number system
* Hospital capacity is the key indicator for ending the number system. Green,
  is 30%. Yellow is up to 100%. Red is above 100%
* When most of the hospitals are green, they will eliminate the number system

Education posters:
* These are being planned
