COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* These are only PCR, it does not cover rapid testing or those who don't get
  tested. The actual numbers are significantly higher than this.
* Health Department release 84 from Thursday
  * Changes
    * 10 new cases
  * 1,435 confirmed cases total
    * 276 recovered
    * 26 deaths total
    * 1,133 active cases
* Tests
  * 154 pending before the update
  * 12 processed
  * 142 still pending

Hospitalisation:
* Total of 70 hospitalised patients in Roatan
  * 15 in the hospital
  * 55 in the COVID center
* No information for Guanaja or Utila
* Does not include private hospital numbers as these have not been supplied to
  the governor

Medical Brigades:
* Today is West End and Santa Elena (which may be delayed due to rain)
* Reports are generated and could be added to these communications

Ferry:
* Galaxy created a COVID-19 section for their ferry in order to move COVID-19
  patients in an affordable manner to the mainland in emergencies

Door to door testing:
* You can refuse to take the test
* Transcribers note: please take the test

Reducing death rate:
* This was why the COVID-19 treatment centers and medical brigades were formed
* The biggest problem right now is people taking too long to get to the
  hospital or COVID-19 treatment center. This is why they're doing the medical
  brigade.
* Are seeing people who are 14+ days into infection before they turn up, which
  is very dangerous.

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Travel tests:
* Rapid tests will now be accepted for entering the Bay Islands and those using
  them will not need to quarantine
* Transcribers note: PCR within 72 hours is still required to enter Honduras,
  this only impacts domestic travel
