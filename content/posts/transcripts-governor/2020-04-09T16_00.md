Quarantine Breech
-----------------

Police officers travelled from Tegucigalpa to Roatan:
* Reports of chief of police and other offices coming onto Roatan from the
  mainland, were true
  * Islands closed down on the 14th of March, chief of police travelled to
    Tegucigalpa after this for his vacation and it was explained that he was to
    stay there during the emergency.
    * Police chief asked if he could come back and was told he could not.
    * He came back to Roatan despite this.
* Minister of security gave an order last night requiring everyone who came to
  Roatan to return to Tegucigalpa. 12 police officers and 3 naval officers
  returned.
* The remedies for this are:
  * The police and naval officers have been returned to Tegucigalpa
  * Everyone who is returning to Gelcap will be tested upon arrival
  * The results of those tests will be shared with us through the Governor
  * Everyone who came in contact with the police and naval officers is now in
    21 day quarantine.
  * The building they were in on Roatan has been sanitised
  * The minister of security has certified that this will not happen again
* Legally, the chief of police could do what he did. It's not good, but it was
  legal due to the state of emergency and the chief of police being the highest
  local authority.
  * The minister of security gave the order for them to return, which overrides
    the local authority.
* [Press Conference in
  English](https://www.facebook.com/BayIslandsJourneyNewsUnfilteredOfficial/videos/218411922590957/) by the mayor
