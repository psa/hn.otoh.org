COVID-19
--------

Testing:
* 7 tests for those who think they might have had symptoms in the past, all
  negative

Systematic testing
* Central government will do random tests as we reopen

Spread of COVID-19 on the mainland:
* The whole Northern coast has a lot of COVID-19 at the moment
* Insufficient testing overall to be safe
* Out of 2,000 cases, 800 in Cortez
* Expect more testing in La Ceiba shortly which will give us better numbers

Accuracy of antibody test:
* Depends on the test
* Biggest question is when they become efficient, they typically take 10 days
  of having the virus to be effective (but you can have pneumonia in 7 days)
* Note from Paul: [A recent analysis](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)

Ventilators and test kits from USA:
* Some kits from mainland, but nothing from USA yet

Reopening
---------

Reopening:
* This is the only department in the country with this authorisation
* Needs to be step by step, not all at once. We need to do this the right way.
* Soft opening, make sure everything runs to allow for troubleshooting
* Thursday and Friday, every business in Roatan can be open 06:00-18:00
  * This means restaurants can not be open late, but can be otherwise fully
    open including sitting down to eat in
  * No night diving (although dive shops allowed to open during the day)
* Number 9 can travel anywhere on Roatan on Thursday, 0 can do so on Friday
  * Only these numbers are permitted on these days
  * Employees: any number is ok
* Businesses need to follow biosecurity protocols, slow open allows for
  preparing for full open next week
* Sat/Sun are complete shutdown
* Monday 18 May, local government will make proposals for how next week will
  work. Completely up to them.
* Sunday there will be a communication about what's happening
* All government offices must be open on Monday
  * Includes immigration
* As long as we do this responsibly, we'll be able to stay open
* There will be auditing next week
  * Failure to comply with biosecurity measures will cause businesses to be
    closed again

Biosecurity measures:
* Business:
  * Require clients have masks on
  * Entrance must have place to disinfect shoes and hands at entrance and ensure
    everyone is disinfected
  * Keep crowds down
* Personal:
  * Masks are mandatory
  * For restaurants, it's for entering. Can remove to eat, tables should be
    well separated.

Enforcing biosecurity:
* Roatan hired 40 auditors who will go business to business to help people
  comply
* Repeat offenders will eventually be closed

Diving:
* Recommend no more than 50% boat loading
* Make sure people come to shop with masks on and only take off when there
* Will not have to report to patronatos to dive

Overstay fines:
* No penalties if your time expired during crisis
* Will get feedback on process for those not on Roatan

Fishing at night:
* Still not approved

Drivers licenses:
* Can renew next week

Beach:
* OK if walking, not if driving

Schools
* No plans yet

Travel
------

Commission for Roatan returning islanders meeting:
* Next week have cruise ships come in to just drop off Hondurans
  * Royal Caribbean and Disney approved
  * For Norwegian, recommend they drop Bay Islanders off first in Roatan before
    heading to San Pedro Sula
* Around 200, around 5% from Bay Islands
* Will go straight to Cortez if from mainland or quarantine if an islander
* Case by case, cruise ship has been at sea without contact for 45 days so
  they're likely uncontaminated
* 169 people total trying to get back to Bay Islands, won't sacrifice 100,000
  people for this. The commission is managing it to keep everyone safe.
  * Commission is made up of those fighting for the rights of these people

Airports and international flights in:
* Not sure when that'll happen

Hotels as quarantine:
* Not easy, many don't want to do that either, so not currently in the plan

Charter from MIA to RTB:
* Send letter to commission in charge of getting islanders back to the islands

Positive antibody and negative current infection be permitted in?
* This is case by case, depending on the tests

General
-------

Call with ministers this morning:
* Monday afternoon they had asked for respiratory illness statistics of Bay
  Islands for last 4 years so could compare today to prior
* Basically gave the green light

Meeting with fishing industry:
* Recognise jobs involved here, aiming to get them back operating ASAP

La Ceiba relief:
* Oversight committee meeting to review proposal on Friday

UTH:
* Usually operates after 18:00, so not sure if they'll be open or not

Fumigation:
* Has continued for dengue and malaria

Quarantine for those who broke the law by breaking quarantine
* It's their obligation to buy their own food to save funds for those with
  COVID-19 who have not broken the law
* Those who test positive and have not broken the law will get a proper place
  to stay and food

Bank limiting to USD 20:
* Not sure, will look into it as that's low

Concern about police abuse
* Record their name, place of the blockade and the time, then report them
