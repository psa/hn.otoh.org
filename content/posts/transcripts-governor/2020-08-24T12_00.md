Travel and Immigration
----------------------

American Airlines flight:
* 57 passengers
* A slow start, but it's a start
* Weekly flight, there's one scheduled next Saturday too

Airlines in general:
* Airlines are doing things by the book
  * Require a test within 72 hours
  * Some people were turned away from the flight as documents were checked
    at check in.
  * Can be a rapid or PCR test, if you can't get a PCR test done in under 72
    hours then the governor recommends getting a rapid test

Tourism and curfew:
* Bay Islands is a tourism based economy, so some leeway on the digit system is
  being given to tourists
* Any tourist with a copy of their reservation at a hotel/rental/etc can go out
  any day of the week, regardless of the last digit on their ID
  * Bay Islands authorities tried to get this for everyone, but central
    government only accepted it for tourists
  * Asks that any place of lodging explain these rules to guests
  * Rental cars are also an acceptable justification if you don't have a hotel
    reservation

Tourists and quarantine:
* Need to stay inside the resort
* Can not do out of resort activities such as diving
* Rapid tests require a 14 day quarantine. PCR does not require quarantine
* If tourists don't respect quarantine, it is not breaking the law and the
  there is no punishment beyond possibly spreading/contracting COVID-19

Internal travel:
* It is possible to go to La Ceiba for the weekend and come back
* All internal visitors are requested to take at least a rapid test before
  visiting the bay islands. This is not mandatory, but is requested to help
  keep COVID-19 under control.
* Island authorities originally pushed for internal travelers to also have
  mandatory tests, but airlines successfully lobbied against it and they met in
  the middle with international passengers being required to have testing and
  local passengers being asked.

Utila requires a PCR test:
* This is a local government decision

Ferries:
* A press release is being worked on for the ferry system, including the Galaxy
* Will be shared as soon as it's released

General
-------

Please Wear Masks:
* It is very important to avoid having another shutdown
* The best way to avoid another shutdown is for everyone to wear a mask

Fire at the dump:

Businesses:
* A lot of businesses have decided not to open, even though they're permitted
  to open. The authorities can not force a business to be open.
* All businesses can be open, if they want to, until 20:00
  * 60% of workforce in Roatan
  * 80% of workforce on all other islands
