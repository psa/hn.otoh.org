* Details will be released personally to people coming, aim to help those with
  primary residency in the Bay Islands and avoid abuse

Repatriation Flights into the Bay Islands:
* These are coming, more info Friday

Immigration:
* Can extend visa via [website](http://www.inm.gob.hn/)
  * Site is only in Spanish, use translation software to view in English
    * Spanish is the legal language of Honduras, so don't expect an English
      version
  * Site is still in development and has known issues

* Update visa at least 48 hours before flight
* Have 5 days after paying fines to leave Honduras

Panga from Roatan to Guanaja
* Mayor of Guanaja says they were apprehended
* Patrols are volunteer based, keeping an eye out is difficult and sometimes
  things will be missed

Proving a second home:
* The current priority is Honduran citizens and residents
* If not a resident, it will be case by case

Reopening to tourists:
* Have a target date, but not sharing until everything is confirmed
