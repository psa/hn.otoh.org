COVID-19
--------

General
-------

The governor had several meetings today:
* President and all the governors to see how each district is doing, where
  limitations and areas of strength are.
* Medical donations and test kits

The governor polled people on the chat asking if they thought the Bay Islands
should open at a local level (about 150 people responded):
* Yes (with bio security): 81%
* Yes (only certain industries, also with biosecurity): 14%
* No: 5% (in Spanish was 9%)

Lots of businesses have reached their ends as far as continuing to pay people
while the islands are shut down, so unemployment has increased.

Police jobs:
* Roatan is looking to hire more police, please drop CV at mayors office

Masks:
* Mayors office on Roatan just ordered a lot of masks for those who can't
  afford them.

Call out to Czech Republic for all the help the Bay Islands have gotten from
there.
