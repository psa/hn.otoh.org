Tomorrows transmissions will still happen

COVID-19
--------

Antibody testing:
* 7 tests completed, all negative for antibodies
* Have 200 tests total, are going through the list of people who have requested
  testing due to a strong suspicion of COVID-19 earlier in the year or last
  year
* This only tests if the person had COVID-19 in the past
* Need to have the virus for 10 days before it's detectable with these tests so
  they can't be used as quick tests 

Quick testing:
* Have some, but using them for special situations

Reopening
---------

Opening:
* Any business can be open 06:00 - 18:00 Thursday/Friday
  * No limitations (i.e. alcohol can be served)
* Still restricted to 9 on Thursday (today) and 0 Friday
* Allows for soft opening and business planning
* Allows businesses to also work out if they can comply with biosecurity
  requirements
* Not mandatory, up to businesses to decide if they're opening
* If you are not a 9 or 0, you can still travel if you're heading to/from work
* Saturday and Sunday will be closed
* Updates for next week on Sunday
* There some thought towards moving this to 22:00 - 06:00, but that's still in
  the analysis phase

Concerns:
* Governor mentioned that if there are mass gatherings and people going out
  without masks, it's likely we'll be shutdown again quickly.
* Please be careful with social distance (2 meters) and ensure masks are worn
  when outside

Beaches:
* Need to be 9 on Thursday or 0 on Friday
* Hoping to be open fully next week, but won't have final answer for a few days

Taxis and Buses:
* These are running now

Next week:
* Still waiting for municipalities and central government to come to an
  agreement
* Gathering size limitations are also still under discussion

Children going out:
* Children can go out, please keep groups small
* Keep social distance guidelines (2 meters) in mind

General
-------

Returning islanders:
* Being actively worked on by the commission.

Churches:
* Make sure everyone is wearing a mask
* Have smaller services more frequently to allow for social distance

Updates from Guanaja, Utila:
* They're following instructions
* Someone came illegally into Guanaja and it was locked down until the person
  was found. That person is now in quarantine.

Airlines:
* It's up to them to petition to come back
* There's some discussion of them coming in June.
* Lobbying airlines has been difficult in the past, if you have contacts feel
  free to lobby them to make a formal petition

Patrolling:
* There will still be patrols and dive boats will do patrols as part of their
  operations, there are dive spots all around the island which will be visited

Bonacca:
* Lock down until the end of the month due to someone entering illegally
