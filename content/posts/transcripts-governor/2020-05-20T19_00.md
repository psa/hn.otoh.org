* Too early to tell if these will actually fly

Quarantine costs:

* People who can't afford to pay, will be subsidised
* Can't subsidise everyone as the money can more effectively help more people
  in other ways

General
-------

Governor opinion posts:
* Can be found at the [Governors Facebook
  Page](https://www.facebook.com/dinogsilvestri/)
* Has been particularly concerned about fake news spreading.
  * We have not yet had any COVID-19 cases
  * Police have **not** come to the islands from the mainland
* Lots of anonymous Facebook pages which are posting fake news

RECO:
* Understand that there's a problem, everyone has received very high bills
  * Governor has also seen a huge power bill increase despite his businesses
    not running, so he's intimately familiar with the problem
* Need a couple of days to form a plan to fix it
* If you're going to protest, please be peaceful
* Have been in discussion with 6-7 people who are representing protestors
  * Some are willing to wait, others are not, puts government in difficult
    situation
* Teargas is a police decision, not a government decision
  * A rock hit a police officer and cracked their head
  * A protestor was also injured
  * Vehicles have been vandalised
* Please avoid violence
* The governor does not have any investments in RECO

Banks:
* Some banks are doing the last digit system, others are not
* All of them have promised to be off the number system by Monday
* Bank withdrawal limit?
  * Please let the governor know which bank

Food:
* Please let the governor know where food is required

Projects from donations:
* Oversight committee identified that Guanaja needs priority help:
  * It has priority right now as it's remote and hasn't gotten as much help as
    other places at this time.
  * This doesn't mean that Utila and other places in the Bay Islands won't get
    projects in the future.
* About 35-40% of donated funds allocated

Utila Fundraising:
* Utila has a separate fund (see left sidebar)
* This fund won't solve all of Utilas problems, the central fund still expects
  to help Utila as needs arise.

Santos Guardiola Closure:
* This is a join decision with authorities and mayor
* Only 9 people turned themselves in, took pressure to find the rest
* Santos Guardiola is included in the repatriation plan

Central government support:
* They did financial transfers to the mayors office
* Used for buying food and hiring medical staff

A second RADAR for the east of Roatan?
* Would need a second one
* The one on the west was donated by a person there

Treatment for COVID-19?
* There is no treatment for COVID-19 at this time
* There are some prophylactic measures which make it less severe if you get it
* More information is in Thursdays press conference

Schools:
* They're in the works

Hospital for Bonnaca:
* That would be difficult, they're based on population
* The hospital on Roatan will be for all the Bay Islands
* It should be much cheaper than going to the mainland

Summary of all government edicts:
* Governor agrees this is a good idea
