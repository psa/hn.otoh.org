Peak outbreak of COVID-19
* This week is expected to be the peak in the Bay Islands
* Biosecurity is very important right now
* Wear masks when outside your home
* Don't leave home if you have preconditions

PCR processing on island:
* Of the last 60 positive tests, 15 were processed on island
* Making good use of the local PCR machine

New Hospital:
* Team from central government has come in to work out a financial estimate on
  the costs for finalisation
* Report should be finished by 2020-09-05
* President has assured that the funds have been set aside to finish the
  hospital

Further lock downs
* Lock down and shut down in the future are not seen as being effective
* Main focus is on identifying those at risk and protecting them

Clinic stats for Guanaja and Utila
* Information hasn't been shared with the governor, he will reach out to the
  municipalities

Calling doctors:
* Call +504-8820-2444, the COVID-19 hotline
  * This number may not have WhatsApp support
* Do not call doctors directly

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

COVID-19 declaration on entry:
* Apparently doesn't include a mandatory quarantine component for those
  presenting a rapid test
* Everyone using a rapid test to enter is asked to do a 14 day quarantine

American Airlines:
* Two flights have come in, one completely full, the other 80% full
* Scheduled for every Saturday

Other flights in:
* It's possible to fly into the mainland and then get a local connecting flight

COVID-19 Test results:
* For international travelers the date on the test needs to be within 72 hours
  * Some labs are showing date the sample was taken, others when it was
    processed
  * Health department requires the sample taken within 72 hours, but there's
    some leeway in enforcement.
    * This is apparently 72 hours before check in at the airport, rather than
      arrival. Expect some variation on enforcement.
  * Recognises that some places (such as the USA) it can be difficult to get
    tests that quickly, but it's needed to keep people safe
  * Several flights have come in, so connecting with those who have come on
    them is a great way to find out how to get results quickly.
* National travelers are not required to get a test, but the Bay Islands
  requests that everyone get tested anyway to keep the islands safe

Spraying:
* Cargo and carry on luggage is being sprayed on arrival
* This is probably a peroxide solution
* Some passengers are reporting they were also sprayed down (it's not clear if
  this was on purpose or because the person spraying the carry on luggage
  wasn't being overly accurate/communicative).

US Travel Advisory:
* Mainland Honduras is a very different place from the Bay Island
* Biggest problem is organised gangs which have been taking control in the
  absence of law and order on the mainland.
* The Bay Islands doesn't have an organised gang problem

Visas:
* Honduras is issuing 90 day visas to tourists who are eligible for them

General
-------

Digit system
* Scheduled to 2020-09-06 (Sunday)
* Not sure if it'll continue beyond then
* Today is zero

Rumors:
* Doctors have been paid recently, including 2020-08-19. Rumors suggesting
  otherwise are false.
* Delta has not been denied by the government, all airlines can schedule
  flights at this point.

Businesses
* Working with central government to try and get reimbursement for businesses
  which kept people on payroll during the lockdown
