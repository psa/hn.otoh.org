COVID-19 Testing and Treatment
------------------------------

Cases:
* Health Department release 70
  * 503 confirmed cases total
    * 127 recovered
    * 10 deaths (1.9% mortality rate, normal is 2-5%)
    * 366 active cases
  * 148 tests processed
  * 268 tests pending results
* Current hospitalisations:
  * Roatan Hospital: 19
    * Current capacity is 8, 11 have been added in an emergency manner
    * Please go to the COVID-19 center, not the hospital, for evaluation. This
      allows the hospital to take care of critical patients.
  * COVID-19 center in French Harbour: 20
    * Current capacity is 30, can be easily expanded to 60
  * Guanaja and Utila are still not providing clinic statistics
* Patients are still be admitted, no one will be turned away

Minister in charge of COVID
* Sent a team of specialists who have been managing COVID centers around the
  country
* The Bay Islands numbers have been going up at the same time that San Pedro
  Sula numbers are going down.
  * This means a lot of researchers are going to be allocated to the Bay Islands
* Specialist team is going to do an analysis of hiring more doctors and
  personnel, which will hopefully result in federal funding to improve the
  situation in the Roatan hospital

Medical brigades:
* Aim is to go house to house looking for people who are at risk
* Get people to the clinic so that they can get oxygen if necessary and there
  are no tragedies at home.
* This approach has been very successful in other countries

Infection:
* Some people are focussed on people coming to the islands from outside
* COVID-19 is on the islands, it's already spreading at the community level
  * We need to focus on helping those who are infected on the island rather
    than the possibility of someone bringing it with them.
  * As there are cases on the islands already, it doesn't make sense to close
    down the islands
* Everyone needs to wear a mask, this is the primary way of reducing the spread
  of infection

Masks:
* It can be that you have the virus without knowing and wearing a mask protects
  others.

Oxygen:
* Dive shops are helping out with oxygen tanks
* Ferry companies have agreed to move oxygen tanks free of charge
* No place on Roatan or Utila to produce Oxygen
  * Guanaja has oxygen production
  * Roatan is looking into oxygen production locally

Travel and Immigration
----------------------

Ferry:
* Galaxy is operating normally. 187 passengers
* Utila Dream is also operating today.
  * There's a number of problems with the ferry as people try to look after
    Utila
  * There are legal limits around stopping the ferry
  * Headed to La Ceiba and will be returning to Utila with passengers
* Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Tourism on Roatan asked airlines to
  require tests, they refused as they legally don't have to
  * The local government can only request tests, not force them
* Entry is a constitutional requirement
* Authority for forcing testing
  * On the ocean, the authority is the marine merchant
  * Entry to the islands is a constitutional right
  * Central government was asked to make it a requirement, they refused
    * One of the core issues was the low accuracy of rapid tests
* Companies are not willing to require tests without a legal requirement due
  to concerns about legal liability
  * Local airlines have the same concern, which is why they are also not
    requiring tests without legal backing from central government

United Airlines:
* Trying to schedule a meeting with them about coming into Roatan
* They are flying into San Pedro Sula

American Airlines:
* Is operating weekly flights
* American is the only airline flying directly to Roatan

San Pedro Sula:
* Very cheap flights internationally into SAP right now
* Come into SAP and then do a flight to the islands
* Can also fly into SAP and go to La Ceiba for the ferry

PCR Tests:
* Need to have taken it and have results within 72 hours
* At least one airline is saying that it is from when receiving test results
  * Talk to your airline as they're the ones who are enforcing restrictions
* People have been stopped from boarding in Miami due to tests which are too old

Quick testing:
* Requesting that everyone entering the Bay Islands get at least a quick test
  before coming over

General
-------

Banks:
* Some weren't open on Sunday, the governor is talking to them to fix this
* Banks are supposed to be open every day due to the digit system

Digit System:
* Continues until Sunday 2020-09-13
* Not sure when it will be abolished

Michael McCarry:
* Has arrived on Roatan
* See thank you if you see him, he's responsible fro over USD 500,000 in
  donations

Pastor:
* Spent one night in the private hospital (the family did not want him in the
  public hospital), he's currently in the COVID-19 center
* No person who arrives at the public hospital or the COVID-19 center will be
  turned away
