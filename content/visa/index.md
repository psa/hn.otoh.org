Entry Requirements for Tourists
-------------------------------

* A valid test within 72 hours
  * A PCR test is recommended but no longer required
  * Quick tests will be accepted
* Fill in https://prechequeo.inm.gob.hn with details of testing before your
  flight
* Domestic travelers are requested to get tested before traveling

Residency
---------

If you are renewing a residency permit, [Bette
Booth](https://www.facebook.com/bette.booth0) put together great guide on
how to do it, which you can get [here](/visa/residency-renewal.pdf).

This uses the online renewal system
[here](http://atencionenlinea.inm.gob.hn:8443/appALAMcliente) but be aware that
this is not secure. If you are not comfortable with your details being
transmitted unencrypted over the internet then you should discuss renewal with
your immigration lawyer.

Grace Period
------------

You will not be required to pay a fine if your visa expired during the pandemic
lockdown.

* Start: 2020-03-16
* End: 2020-08-04

Anyone who stays beyond the end of the grace period needs to renew their visa
or be willing to pay the overstay fines. The alternative is to leave, but
without residency you will not be able to return until the borders are
re-opened to tourism.

Tourist Visa Extensions
-----------------------

There have been discussions of online forms, but these are currently only
available for extending residency permits.

Overstay
--------

If you have to pay a fine, make sure that you leave enough time to visit the
bank after getting the penalty notice from immigration. The bank will give you
a receipt which you can take back to immigration certifying payment. Note that
banks are frequently requiring close toed shoes, so keep that in mind when
deciding on what you will wear to travel.

Below is the 2020 costs of overstaying a visa. They are based on minimum wage
