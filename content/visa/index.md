Residency
---------

If you are renewing a residency permit, [Bette
Booth](https://www.facebook.com/bette.booth0) put together great guide on
how to do it, which you can get [here](/visa/residency-renewal.pdf).

This uses the online renewal system
[here](http://atencionenlinea.inm.gob.hn:8443/appALAMcliente) but be aware that
this is not secure. If you are not comfortable with your details being
transmitted unencrypted over the internet then you should discuss renewal with
your immigration lawyer.

Tourist Visa Extensions
-----------------------

If you want to extend a tourist visa to 120 days you need to visit an office.

Overstay
--------

If you have to pay a fine, make sure that you leave enough time to visit the
bank after getting the penalty notice from immigration. The bank will give you
a receipt which you can take back to immigration certifying payment. Note that
banks are frequently requiring close toed shoes, so keep that in mind when
deciding on what you will wear to travel.
