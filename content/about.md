For those who don't have Facebook or don't have a lot of bandwidth, this site
aims to provide the latest information and summaries of all video chats with
the Mayor of Utila, Troy Bodden Sr., and the Governor of the Bay Islands, Dino
Silvestri.

We will also keep other critical information in a summarised, easy to access
form, including curfews and useful Facebook and WhatsApp groups.

This is a volunteer effort and, as such, may be a few hours behind the latest
updates.
