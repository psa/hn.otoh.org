* Trying to minimise problems with theft when people are desperate
* Please get in touch so the municipality can buy your products and hand them
  out to the poor.

Doctors
* If you are a doctor or have medical experience, please contact the mayor
* Only 8 doctors in Utila and 1 in the Keys, need more medical help
* If suspected case is positive, then we'll need to take drastic measures and
  will need assistance doing so.
