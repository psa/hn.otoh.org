This page lists the WhatsApp groups which are public and coordinating various
activities around Utila (mostly flights off for those who want to leave).

**Note:** If you do not need to be in a chat, please leave it as there's a 256
person limit in each group and you might be stopping someone who needs to be
there from gaining access.

Private Charters
================

**Notes:**
* These are private charters and are not being organised through the embassy or
  any Honduran government offices.
* Do not, under any circumstances, pay anything until you see approvals to
  arrive from the governor. Until they get an official approval (which includes
  checks of their legitimacy), they are definitely not coming.
* The charter being setup by Alisha Bush had a lot of overlap with Global
  Guardian passengers and no longer has enough passengers to fly, so is
  cancelled.

* [Small Charters to the USA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DWutmphthC96LH4imQJB0t)
  * Organising small (~25 people) charters to the USA
  * Pricing is approximately USD 2,800 per person for a 14 seater and USD 3,313
    per person for an 8 seater
* [Global Guardian](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EJQiAP1P0hS1MUmGzKlWjb):
  * Mail operationscenter at globalguardian dot com
  * If plane is full, cost is USD 1,324 per seat. More if not full.
  * Going to Miami
  * One plane left on 2020-03-22, they'll schdule another if there's enough
    interest.

If you are trying to organise a charter, the governor needs the following
(**NB:** charters of 15 or fewer are easier to get grants for):
* Aircraft tail number:
* Aircraft type:
* Pilot-in-Command:
* Arrival Date and Time in Honduras
* Departure Date and Location from the United States
* Departure Date, Time, and Location in Honduras
* Passenger list including:
