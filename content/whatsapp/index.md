This page lists the WhatsApp groups which are public and coordinating various
activities around Utila (mostly flights off for those who want to leave).

**Note:** If you do not need to be in a chat, please leave it as there's a 256
person limit in each group and you might be stopping someone who needs to be
there from gaining access.
